# Logistic-Regression

Logistic regression in Machine Learning is a supervised machine learning algorithm that accomplishes binary classification tasks by predicting the probability of an outcome, event, or observation. The model delivers a binary or dichotomous outcome limited to two possible outcomes: yes/no, 0/1, or true/false.
