# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning Projects: Execution of ML Models on Kaggle datasets using Google Collab.

This repository is purely dedicated to  the existing machine learning models in the world and has shown proper use of the models on sample datasets using the python language. 

I have branched the main repository to sub-branches for proper segregation of the projects on the basis of ML models used.

Repository Branches :-
-> Logistic Regression 
-> Support-Vector Machine(SVM)

The repository also displays the use of python Library.
Python Library in use :-
• Numpy
• Pandas
• sklearn
• matplotlib
